<h1>Portland Accessibility and User Experience Meetup (PDX A11Y UX)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Portland Accessibility and User Experience (<abbr>PDX A11Y UX</abbr>) Meetup addresses how to incorporate accessibility and universal design principles into project planning, user research, and UX evaluation. We are based in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" rel="external">Portland, Oregon</a> metro area.</p>

<p>This meetup hosts an ongoing conversation about how to create in a way that is inclusive to the greatest number of people possible — meaning those with and without disabilities.</p>

<p>The accessibility conversation is timely around the world and locally in our Portland tech community. Some join the conversation to mitigate legal risks, others are motivated by social justice purposes, while many find that building accessibility early into a development lifecycle improves user experience.</p>

<p>PDX A11Y UX acts as a resource for Portland based companies and individuals interested in accessibility, universal design, and inclusive design. We encourage you to use the #PDXa11yUX hashtag for accessibility topics you are interested in seeing in the future with our group.</p>

Whether you're a developer, designer, or advocate, you'll walk away with practical ways to boost visibility, build momentum, and reframe accessibility as something people want to rally around accessibility as a movement, not check boxes. (Spoiler alert: you’re the one who can make it happen!)</p>
