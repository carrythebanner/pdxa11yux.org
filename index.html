<h1>Portland Accessibility and User Experience Meetup (PDX A11Y UX)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Portland Accessibility and User Experience (<abbr>PDX A11Y UX</abbr>) Meetup addresses how to incorporate accessibility and universal design principles into project planning, user research, and UX evaluation. We are based in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" rel="external">Portland, Oregon</a> metro area.</p>

<p>This meetup hosts an ongoing conversation about how to create in a way that is inclusive to the greatest number of people possible — meaning those with and without disabilities.</p>

<p>The accessibility conversation is timely around the world and locally in our Portland tech community. Some join the conversation to mitigate legal risks, others are motivated by social justice purposes, while many find that building accessibility early into a development lifecycle improves user experience.</p>

<p>PDX A11Y UX acts as a resource for Portland based companies and individuals interested in accessibility, universal design, and inclusive design. We encourage you to use the #PDXa11yUX hashtag for accessibility topics you are interested in seeing in the future with our group.</p>

  <h3 id="event-20250924">Accessibility Development Coaching: Engineering Teams Toward Maturity [virtual] — September 24</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><time>Wednesday, September 24th, 2025, 6:00pm–7:30pm</time></li>
    <li>Virtual event
    <li>Location: Online; RSVP on Meetup or email for a meeting link</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Topic</h4>

  <p>Our coaching practice blends the sharp eye of an engineer with the steady guidance of a mentor. We work directly with development teams to level up their accessibility maturity—teaching not just the how of accessible code, but the why of inclusive design. Coaches serve as half engineer, half strategist: diving into code reviews, walking through practical fixes, and helping teams adopt sustainable practices. The goal isn’t just compliance—it’s building teams that confidently deliver accessible products, sprint after sprint, until accessibility becomes as natural as writing a div.</p>
